## Introduction

Pediatric Emergency Medicine App is designed for healthcare workers such as nurse practitioners, physician assistants, residents in pediatric, emergency medicine and family medicine residency programs, fellows in pediatric emergency medicine, and attending physicians in emergency and urgent care settings that provide acute care to sick and injured children. The app will provide updated medical information quickly and clearly for the common medical emergencies that are seen in emergency departments and urgent care settings.

## Essential Tutorials
### React-Native 

React Native is like React, but it uses native components instead of web components as building blocks. So to understand the basic structure of a React Native app, you need to understand some of the basic React concepts, like JSX, components, state, and props. If you already know React, you still need to learn some React-Native-specific stuff, like the native components. This tutorial is aimed at all audiences, whether you have React experience or not.

### Expo

In this tutorial we are going to build an app for iOS, Android, and web that allows you to share photos with your friends! Of course there are already plenty of apps that let you share photos from your phone, you just can't do it with your own app. Let's remedy that. [Click Here](https://docs.expo.io/tutorial/planning)

### Redux

The Redux Essentials tutorial is a "top-down" tutorial that teaches how to use Redux the right way, using our latest recommended APIs and best practices. We recommend starting there. [Click Here](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/essentials/part-1-overview-concepts)

### Firebase

This tutorial is slightly outdated but it is a really nice guide if you want to get a good idea about how firebase works. [Click Here](https://youtu.be/9kRgVxULbag)
